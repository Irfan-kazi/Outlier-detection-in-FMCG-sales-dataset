Outlier-detection-in-FMCG-sales-dataset
Project demonstartingÂ outlier detection methods using FMCG sales data from the real world.
In the FMCG sector, keeping a competitive edge depends on precise sales forecasting and market analysis. Outliers in sales statistics are frequently present as a result of supply chain disruptions, seasonal changes, and marketing initiatives. Exact data analysis and well-informed strategic decision-making depend on the ability to recognize and manage these anomalies.
We utilize the "Retail Sales Time Series Forecasting" dataset from Kaggle, which is accessible to the general public. This dataset contains historical sales information from a variety of FMCG-related products and retail locations.
